zboooom, zip bombs generator.


The attached zip file is **30KB** externally but when you decompress it you will find **40GB+** of null bytes generated in **375.77 seconds** (6.25 minutes).


⚠️ Note: `The tool depends on how much ram you have, since the operation relies on writing content to the ram then writing it to the zip file then flushing it from the ram.`
